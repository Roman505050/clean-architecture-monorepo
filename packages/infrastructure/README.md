# Infrastructure Layer

This layer is responsible for managing the infrastructure of the application. It contains all the code that is responsible for interacting with external systems, such as databases, queues, caches, etc. It is dependent on the domain layer and application layer, but independent of Web, CLI, and other interfaces.
